# Introduction

-   Describe the data
-   Describe how the data sets are used
-   Research question and hypothesis

```{r extrascrubbing}
# this section is for fixing the data sets to our needs

dispensaries <- clean_dispensaries |>
    filter(str_starts(postal_code, "M")) |>
    filter(application_status == "Authorized to Open")

```

## Methodology

-   Think about the process, considering what we will do

## Result

### Summaries of Data sets

-   overall reason for summaries and introduction to this section

-   

    ### Busisnesses

-   background on businesses

-   just relating what is noticed

-   reason for data set

-   describe distribution if we can

```{r businesses}
library(skimr)
library(modelsummary)

#Numerical Summary
look_at_businesses <-
  datasummary_skim(clean_businesses)
look_at_businesses

#Numerical Correlation (No categorical available)
businesses_correlation <-
  datasummary_correlation(clean_businesses)
businesses_correlation

#Cleaning Businesses even further
businesses <- clean_businesses |>
    filter(`licence_address_line_3` |> 
             str_starts("M")) |>
  filter(category |> str_detect(paste(
        c(
            "RETAIL STORE \\(FOOD\\)",
            "SMOKE SHOP",
            "VAPOUR PRODUCT RETAILER"
        ),
        collapse = "|"
    )))
```

### Dispensaries

-   background on dispensary data:
-   relaying the info on what is noticed
-   reason for data set
-   describe distribution if we can

```{r dispensaries}
# Numerical summary
look_at_dispensaries <-
  datasummary_skim(clean_dispensaries)
look_at_dispensaries

# Numerical Correlation
dispensaries_correlation <-
  datasummary_correlation(clean_dispensaries)
dispensaries_correlation

# Categorical summaries
disp_cat <-
  datasummary_skim(clean_dispensaries, "categorical")
disp_cat
```

### Neighborhoods

-   background on neighborhood data
-   relaying the info on what is noticed
-   reason for data set
-   describe distribution if we can

```{r neighbourhoods}
# Categorical Data only avaliable 
look_at_neighbourhoods <-
  datasummary_skim(clean_neighbourhoods, "categorical")
look_at_neighbourhoods
```

### Intersections

-   background on intersections data
-   relaying the info on what is noticed
-   reason for data set
-   describe distribution if we can

```{r intersections}

# Numerical Summary
new_table <-
  datasummary_skim(clean_intersections)
new_table


# Categorical Summary
look_at_intersections <-
  datasummary_skim(clean_intersections, "categorical")
look_at_intersections

```

### Postal Codes

-   background on postal code data
-   relaying the info on what is noticed
-   reason for data set
-   describe distribution if we can

```{r postalcodes}
# Numerical Summary
look_at_postal_codes <-
  datasummary_skim(clean_postal_codes)
look_at_postal_codes

# Correlation table postal code
the_codes<-
  datasummary_correlation(clean_postal_codes)
the_codes

```

### Visualizations

```{r}
# for some reason I cannot read this anymore

dispensaries.sf <- st_as_sf(
    dispensaries,
    coords = c("Longitude", "Latitude"), crs = 4326
)
dispensaries_per_neighbourhood <- data.neighbourhoods |>
    st_contains(dispensaries.sf) |>
    lengths()
data.neighbourhoods |>
    bind_cols("dispensary_count" = grid_intersect) |>
    ggplot(aes(fill = dispensary_count)) +
    geom_sf() +
    geom_point(
        data = dispensaries,
        mapping = aes(x = Longitude, y = Latitude),
        color = "cyan",
        size = .5,
        alpha = .5,
        inherit.aes = F
    ) +
    scale_fill_viridis_c("Dispensaries", option = "magma")
```

```{r}

FSA <- read_sf("data", "ONfsa") |> filter(str_starts(FSA, "M"))
